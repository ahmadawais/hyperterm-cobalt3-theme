# Cobalt2 for Hyperterm

![](http://d.pr/i/fLuj.jpg)

This is a purple color fork of Cobalt2 hyperterm theme by my friend Wes Bos.

## Installing

1. Open your `~/.hyperterm.js` config file with something like `subl ~/.hyperterm.js` or `vim ~/.hyperterm.js`.
2. Add `hyperterm-cobalt3-theme` to your `plugins` array. Kinda like this:

	```js
	plugins: [
	  'hyperterm-cobalt3-theme'
	],
	```
3. Enjoy your life

## FAQ

### Q: What font is that? I Love It!
**A:** Operator Mono. I wrote a bit of info here â†’ <http://wesbos.com/uses>

### Q: How do I get Powerline working with a non-patched font?
**A:** Use CSS to fall back to a different font when the character isn't supported:

```
fontFamily: '"Operator Mono", "Inconsolata for Powerline", monospace'
```

### Q: I HATE THAT FONT SO MUCH, I HATE YOU AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW IT
**A:** k ðŸ˜˜

### Q: How did you get the cool prompt?
**A:** This isn't part of iTerm or Hyperterm, it has to do with the shell that you are using. I'm using ZSH along with [Cobalt 2 for ZSH](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm/). I've got a whole free video series on this if you are interested:  <http://CommandLinePowerUser.com>

### Q: Can I make edits?
**A:** Yes please! Still working on this. I might not accept your edits, but I probably will.
